- **CC BY-ND**: Allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to the original creation.
- **CC BY-NC**: Allows users to remix, adapt, and build upon the work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge the original creation and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.
- **CC BY-NC-SA**: Allows users to remix, adapt, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as they credit the original creation and license their new creations under the identical terms.
